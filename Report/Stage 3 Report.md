The World Health Organization (WHO) has undertaken a comprehensive global initiative aimed at combating cholera by systematically collecting and analyzing data to evaluate the disease’s impact on human health. This effort, in collaboration with healthcare professionals and organizations worldwide, involves extensive data collection that traces cholera outbreaks and transmission patterns from as far back as the 19th century.

Worldwide, the reported cases and deaths have been rising  with highest cases reported between the year 1990 and 2020.   Despite the high reported cases the number of deaths were reportedly lowered. This can be attributed  to  interventions  put forward to mitigate Cholera outbreaks. Based on the global distribution of cholera cases, Africa has reported the highest burden, accounting for 43.6% of all cases worldwide. In contrast, Europe (0.2%) and Oceania have recorded the fewest cases. Despite Asia ranking second in terms of case numbers, it has reported the highest proportion of deaths, with a staggering 79.4% of all cholera-related fatalities. A deeper analysis of country-specific data reveals that India has consistently reported the highest number of cases and deaths over time, followed  by Haiti and Peru. This data highlights significant regional disparities in cholera transmission and mortality, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in the most affected areas.

In Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported the highest number of cholera cases and fatalities, surpassing the figures recorded in other African nations. Within East Africa, Somalia leads with the highest percentage of cholera cases, accounting for 42.3%, followed closely by Ethiopia and Kenya at 16.1%. In terms of fatalities in East Africa, Somalia again ranks the highest, contributing 48.3% of the region's cholera-related deaths, followed by Uganda at 19.6% and Kenya at 17.2%.

A closer examination of Kenya’s cholera data reveals a concerning spike in its case fatality rate (CFR) between 2010 and 2011, where it surged dramatically from 3% to 27%. This sharp rise raised alarm over the country’s cholera management and response capacity. However, as Kenya implemented more targeted interventions, including improved access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare, the fatality rate steadily declined, reaching as low as 0.9% by 2015. This trend show how important it is to sustain public health efforts in controlling cholera outbreaks and reducing mortality rates in the region.

For the Frontend part of this task, we created a Shiny web application designed to provide an interactive dashboard for visualizing cholera outbreaks. Users can adjust a slider input to select a year range and a dropdown menu to choose a specific country or view data for all countries. The app also includes an action button to generate a report specifically for Kenya. There are three sections: 
(1) An "Overview" tab that displays a Leaflet map with cholera cases and a summary table, 
(2) A "Trends" tab with line plots for cases, fatalities, and case fatality rate (CFR) over time, and 
(3) A "Reports" tab with a button to download a Kenya-specific cholera report.
